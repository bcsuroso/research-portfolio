## 📜 Academic Research & Writing (Humanities)

### 1. Foucauldian Analysis of Social Media: Trends, Panopticon, and Biopolitics
**Field:** Sociology of Technology & Philosophy
* **Abstract:** This paper investigates social media through Michel Foucault’s frameworks of **Panopticism** and **Biopolitics**. It argues that social media trends act as a disciplinary mechanism where users function as both guards and prisoners. Furthermore, it analyzes how algorithms exercise biopolitical power by managing user visibility and amplifying conformity to maximize the 'attention economy'.
* **Key Frameworks:** Foucault’s Panopticon, Biopolitics, Disciplinary Power.

### 2. Resonance of Panem et Circenses: Perpetuating Oligarchy in Indonesia
**Field:** Political History & Comparative Sociology
* **Abstract:** A comparative analysis connecting the Roman concept of *Panem et Circenses* (Bread and Circuses) to modern Indonesia’s political landscape. The study explores how **Oligarchy** and **Feudalism** are maintained through clientelism ('bread' / social aid) and the cultivation of political apathy via entertainment ('circus'), drawing parallels between the fall of the Roman Republic and current democratic challenges.
* **Key Frameworks:** Juvenal’s Satire, Oligarchy Theory (Winters), Clientelism.
